Logging System  
**************

The Logging System of the Spacelab Transmitter shows the events performed in the software - such as when a telecommand was executed - and their respective date and time. 


Operation
#########

The logfile is automatically generated inside a default folder in the user home page in the archives called "spacelab_transmitter", but in the preferences of the software the user can choose in which folder to save the file.

The generated archive is a .csv file displaying date and time on one column and the event on the other one. The event can be a successfull transmission, an error or even the software startup.
