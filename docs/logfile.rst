The Logging System of the Spacelab Transmitter shows the events performed in the software - such as when a telecommand was executed - and their respective date and time.

Operation
**********

The logfile is automatically generated inside a default folder in the user home page in the archives called "spacelab_transmitter". It is a .csv file displaying date and time on one column and the event on the other one. 

Future updating includes an option to choose the file folder.
