The Spacelab Package Transmitter is a Python in-development software to transmit packages to satellites.

A list of known satellites that are planned to use this software are presented below:

* **FloripaSat-1** [1]_
* **GOLDS-UFSC (a.k.a. FloripaSat-2)** [2]_


The two satellites of the list above are developed (or in development) by the same research group: the *Space Technology Research Laboratory* (SpaceLab) [3]_, from *Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina* (Brazil).

The objective of this software is to become the "universal" software of the Spacelab's Satellites to transmit packages to any of its satellites.
